Recently, we pushed out an update that was written from scratch using native Android APIs. Several users reported problems such as overheating and crashing in the new app. While we iron out these issues, we decided to revert the app back to its legacy version. This version of the app includes some upgraded components (HyperChat) and bugfixes, but development on the legacy app/extension has been inactive for several months. If you are a developer who would like to take over the maintenance of the legacy app, please contact us in our Discord server. The new native Android app will be available through the Google Play store beta program as it was previously.
