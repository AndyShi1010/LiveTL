  You can now filter chat messages from verified users (enabled by default)!

<ExpandingCard title="Feature hints" icon="info">
  When some recommended features are available but not enabled (ex. translator
  spotlighting), a nice animation will be shown to let you know! Our hope is
  that this will reveal features built into LiveTL that you may not have known
  about.
</ExpandingCard>
<ExpandingCard title="Chat layout options" icon="chat">
  You can now flip the placement of the chat and the LiveTL panel! Head over to
  the settings menu to fiddle with your layout.
