<ExpandingCard title="HyperChat improvements" icon="verified_user">
  HyperChat now stores settings in extension storage! This update is a precursor
  to the next major update, which will include a HyperChat-specific settings
  menu. We also improved chat message timing mechanics, so messages should be a
  little less delayed. PS. We heard that Kiara (my personal oshi) got HyperChat
  -- thank you, and we hope you like it!
