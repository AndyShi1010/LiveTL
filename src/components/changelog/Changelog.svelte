<ExpandingCard title="TLdex Integration" icon="chat" expanded>
  In addition to the YouTube chat, LiveTL now hooks into TLdex (Holodex) to provide
  translations more quickly and more reliably! TLdex fully replaces all MChad functionality
  as the service has been taken offline. Thank you to the Holodex team for making this possible,
  and we wish MonMon Mnemonics (MChad dev) the best of luck with his PhD! o7

  Previously, there were visual bugs when exporting translations as a screenshot or text file.
  The issues have been fixed!
